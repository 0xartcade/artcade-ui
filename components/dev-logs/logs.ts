here we are. i'm not even sure where to begin, so let's start with how we got here. 

my introduction to the blockchain was in 2018 with an on-chain clean water project i led here in canada. but my real introduction was in early 2021 when a handful of artists like myself began to learn about "NFTs" and the impact they could potentially make on the art world.

a few months later, dozens turned to hundreds, then thousands as artists from across genres, disciplines, with varrying skills and experience began "minting" their art on-chain as NFTs and real people started to buy them. 

this was a revelation in the art community and a revolution in the crypto community. could artists finally ignore the algorithms? could they ignore the painful clients? could they actually create what they wanted to create? and could they actually make an honest living? 

could the starving artist finally become a bug, not a feature of the system. 

we almost got there. we really did. we went from developer meetups at the Denver Sports Castle at ETH Denver in 2020 to artists and collectors living it up at art events and parties in Art Basel Miami in 2021 (for the record, i prefer the former but you get the point).

but then, as quickly as it happened it crashed. prices dropped, sales ended, and artists returned to their previous life (some of us with tax bills more than we made). what was left was those who either reached exist velocity with their sales, were too stubborn and bullish on the potential to leave, or had nowhere else to go. 

this project is about reversing this course. fixing history. getting us back onto the path we were on. a path that focused on art. a path that uplifted artists. a path breathed real color, real life, real vibrance into world changing but ultimately boring technology.

time to get to work.`
