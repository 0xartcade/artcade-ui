# Artcade UI
*The main interface for creating profiles, finding games, submitting scores, and managing rewards associated with 0xArtcade*

## Philosophy
Web3 can be difficult to manage, especially on mobile. We have crafted the main discovery and blockchain interaction interface to exist in a desktop and mobile experience separate from the gaemplay itself. This allows maximal flexibility with regards to user onboarding how the experience we can craft in the future.

## Tech Stack
The frontend is written in NextJS, utilizing the following popular libraries:
- Connect Kit
- wagmi
- viem
- react-query
- tailwindcss
- framer motion
- shadcn/ui
